terminal
========

A go-native terminal handler for reading a line with history.
A fork of bitbucket.org/binet/go-terminal which forks code.google.com/p/go.crypto/ssh/terminal

It allows editing a line with arrow keys, and history using up/down arrow keys.

bitbucket.org/binet/go-terminal added some history.

This repo fixed history row copying, and adds functions to set up from stdin/out, and history list getting/setting.
